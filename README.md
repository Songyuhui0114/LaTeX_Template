# China University of Petroleum, Beijing &ndash; LaTeX Dissertation (or Thesis) Template (as for your notes or papers)

It's maybe the best choice for you to take notes or finish dissertations, definitely a great template for all people in my university! 
We can first have a good look at it quickly:

A modern, highly configurable assignment/project/fyp/dissertation/thesis template for the China University of Petroleum, Beijing.  (In reality, there is nothing specific to the China University of Petroleum, and this LaTeX class may be used anywhere).  This template is loosely based on my summer-research Thesis at the Lomonosov Moscow State University, which was loosely based on Dr. Jean.p.Ebejer's D.Phil. Thesis at the University of Oxford, which was loosely based on ...  You get the drift.

The main file is `dissertation_main.tex`, and this will show you how to organise your dissertation.  Basically replace all `\blindtext` commands with your content and you are there, ready to print. This is obviously a case of something more easily said than done.

Please contact with me if you meet any problems in using the template either through pull requests, github issues or emails (songyuhui0114@gmail.com).

Aslo in this path, I will keep up making more useful and beautiful templates if someone on the platform or others in my university like the template.

# Requirements

For this template you will need the beautiful Lato font for headings and also algorithm typesetting from the science packages.  This sans font creates a pleasing contrast with the serif text.  `lato.sty` can be installed (on Ubuntu) with:

```
sudo apt install texlive-fonts-extra texlive-science

```
